THE ONLY FILE IS test.py

THE PURPOSE OF THIS REPO IS TO GET NJITTED NUMBA RUNTIME FUNCTIONS WITH A PRINTF IN THEM WORKING UNDER THE NEW TYPE SYSTEM, AS ENFORCED BY:
os.environ['NUMBA_USE_LEGACY_TYPE_SYSTEM'] = '0'
DO NOT CHANGE NUMBA_USE_LEGACY_TYPE_SYSTEM
DO NOT USE OBJECT MODE
NO NOT REMOVE NJIT FROM THE FUNCTIONS
WE ARE TESTING FSTRINGS.  IT MUST BE AN FSTRING WE ARE PRINTING THE FUNCTION IN.
makestring RETURNS INFORMATIVE TEXT - YOU CAN CHANGE THE RETURNED VALUES INTO BYTEARRAY OR WHATEVER YOU WANT, BUT OBVIOUSLY JUST RETURNING A NUMBER WONT DO.
